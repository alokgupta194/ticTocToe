      <h3>Game</h3>
      <p>
        "Tic-tac-toe" is an easy two-player board game that has been around
        since the 17th century. It is played on a 9x9 grid with three columns
        and three rows, and the goal is to get all of your pieces into a row of
        3 or more pieces, called the "home row." The game can be won in three
        ways: (1) placing your pieces so that they form a 3 in the bottom right
        corner, (2) forming a row of 4 pieces, or (3) forming a row of 5 pieces.
